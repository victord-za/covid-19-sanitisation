# COVID-19 Sanitisation


This repository contains the code for the i-Sanitise tunnel solution to the COVID-19, developed by [Process Solutions Automation (PSA)](https://www.p-s-a.co.za/index.html). The code is written for application on Arduino boards. We made use of the Arduino Uno board. Wiring diagrams for the project will soon be included in this repository.



The material required is as follows:


 - Arduino Uno

 - PIR sensor

 - Solenoid valve

 - 2 Pumps

 - 2 Level switches

 - 5V relay module

 - Jumper cables



There are currently two models of the i-Sanitise tunnel. The main difference being the positioning of the PIR sensor. For model-1 the PIR sensor is placed in the middle of the tunnel, by the spray valves. For model-2 the PIR sensor is placed at the tunnel entrance.
